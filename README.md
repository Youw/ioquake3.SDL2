ioquake3.SDL2
=============
Quake III Arena launcher from http://ioquake3.org/ but ported on SDL2 by me, and now working fine on Windows 8.1 and later.

NOTE: This is very outdated software. There is newer (original, updated and well maintained) version available here: [https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3).
